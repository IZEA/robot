# PIDMutex implements a simple semaphore that can be used to coordinate access
# to shared data from multiple concurrent processes.  It does this by managing
# access to a PID file.
# 
# Generally, this class is meant to be as close as possible to Ruby's standard
# Mutex class, so it can be easily swapped in its place for switching between
# thread- and process-based concurrency.

  # available.
